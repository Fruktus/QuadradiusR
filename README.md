**Project discontinued due to updates to Ruffle which allowed the original to run in web browser. For details visit [QuadradiusPreservationProject](https://github.com/Fruktus/QuadradiusPreservationProject)**

A reimplementation of Classic Quadradius flash game from 2007 made by Jimmi Heiserman and Brad Kayal.

DISCLAIMER: This is a fan work, not related or approved in any way by original authors, Jimmi Heiserman and Brad Kayal. The project is completely non-profit and should be considered as educational only. The provided software does not represent the quality of the original.


## Goals of the project
The main idea is to restore the quadradius to at least a part of its former glory by reimplementing it in newer technology.
This will make it possible to play on mobile devices, in browser, etc.
We aim for the game to be as true to the original as possible, although it goes without saying that since we are recreating everything from scratch some differences may be present.

## Current status and roadmap
At this point in time the game is playable with most core mechanics in place.
There is no way to win, there is only one powerup.

- Milestone 1: Core movement mechanics
- Milestone 2: Networking
- **Milestone 3 (current)**: Last core features and refactoring the code
- Future milestones (not in final order): Animations, sounds, powerups, UI polishing, testing
